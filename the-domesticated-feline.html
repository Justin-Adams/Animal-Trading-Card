			<p>My name is Ellie. I picked this name because my favorite video game is The Last of Us. My dad thought it was a good idea to use me as his animal trading card for his Intro to Programming course (embarrasing). I was a stray but my dad took me in when I was just a kitten. Since food was scarce when I was a street cat, I love a good meal. Especially turkey and chicken but get that seafood out of my face.</p>
